A command line version of the game 'Mastermind' as part of the Ruby Programming course on The Odin Project's website: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop

Currently works but seperate line for every guessed peg is a little inefficient so plan to have input on a single line

After each guess program asks if you want to see the answer while alpha testing for any bugs. Will not be available in full version


Features to add
*Computer guessing
*Multiple rounds
*Easier input
*Way to exit out of program without ctr+c
